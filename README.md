# Kicad-Hydraulics
A library of Hydraulic Components for use in Kicad Eeschema

This library is made of some standard components, and accepted symbols. I use quite a bit of Sun Hydraulics cartridges,
so you will find many of the cartridge part numbers listed in the library.
Other strange symbols might be there, as we work in the subsea industry, sending hydraulics underwater, so some symbols might seem
a little different.
